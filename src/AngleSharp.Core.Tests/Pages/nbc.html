(It also probably wants to avoid any horror stories of individuals who tried to sign up but couldn’t.) “We are experiencing a surge in demand and are making sure that we will be ready to help consumers who may be in line by the deadline to complete enrollment-either online or over the phone,&quot; an administration told NBC News. On the other hand, Republicans are arguing that this is yet another example of the administration making up the rules as they go along. “Another day, another Obamacare delay from the same Obama administration that won’t work with Republicans to help Americans suffering from the unintended consequences of the Democrats’ failed health-care law,” RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement."},{"type":"p","html":""},{"type":"widget","widget_type":"inline-video","mpxId":"207012931896","guid":"n_mj_toptalk1_140326","pubDate":"2014-03-26 11:16:00 Z","expirationDate":"9999-12-31 23:59:59 Z","playbackIsDisabled":false,"availabilityState":"available","title":"A new extension for Obamacare enrollment","description":"Top Talkers: The Obama administration is expected to announce a new change to Obamacare that would allow certain people more time to sign up for coverage.

Standing at the heart of Europe in Brussels, the center of the European project, he will be able to speak about the importance of European security, the importance of not just the danger to the people of Ukraine but the danger to the international system that Europe and the United States have invested so much in that is a consequence of Russia’s actions,” a senior administration told reporters yesterday. “But he’ll also be able to speak more broadly about why the alliance between the United States and Europe is so important to European security but also to the progress of democracy and the sustainment of international law around the world.” A few months ago, this speech was supposed to be heavy on trade and the economy as the president has been trying to negotiate a major regional trade deal between the U.S. and the EU; now it’s much heavier on security and Ukraine.

White House adviser Ben Rhodes also criticized Saudi Arabia: “We were very disappointed by the Saudi decision. We expressly reached out to the Saudi government through multiple channels when we became aware of this issue. We made it clear how important it was to us that this journalist, like any other journalist, have access to cover the president’s trip.” Bottom line: We know Saudi Arabia is frustrated that it doesn’t have a better relationship with President Obama. But that government’s actions -- including the lack of human rights there -- is only going to make it harder for future American presidents to have a close relationship with it, especially when the United States relies less and less on Middle East oil. For a country that used to be seen as being among the most political savvy about its Washington relationships, the country’s government has become remarkably tone deaf of late. This decision to bar the Jerusalem Post reporter is just the latest example."},{"type":"p","html":""},{"type":"p","html":"*** Unforced errors by three prominent Senate candidates: Over the last 48 hours, we’ve witnessed MAJOR unforced errors by three prominent Senate candidates across the country.

And then after the campaign replaced the footage -- to instead feature UK freshman star Julius Randle -- the university sent a cease-and-desist letter (the use of a student athlete’s image in an advertisement isn’t permissible). The McConnell campaign released a statement last night saying it had taken down the video. “It was our intention to honor our great Kentucky basketball traditions.

For Braley, the stereotype is that he’s an elitist trial lawyer who doesn’t understand Iowa’s farming ways. (And it didn’t help that Braley’s unforced error came on the same day as potential GOP opponent Joni Ernst’s buzzy new <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/iowa-candidates-anti-pork-pitch-i-grew-castrating-hogs-n61536\">TV ad</a> about castrating pigs. The error also will probably spur Grassley to play a bigger role in this race, something past Democratic candidates have carefully avoided.)
